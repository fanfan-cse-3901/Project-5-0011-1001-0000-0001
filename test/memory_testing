Unit Testing for memAdd(), memStore(), memMinus(), memReg(), clearMC() in calc.js

console.log("The array at beginning:  " + calculator.mem);
console.log("The array beginning size  " + calculator.mem.length);

1. memAdd()
                current memory: [0]
                input:      0
                expected:   0
                                            pass

                current memory: [1]
                input:      1
                expected:   1
                                            pass

2. AddMinus()

                input:      0
                expected:   0

3. memStore()

                                            pass

4. memReg()

        *The input should not matter and affect the expected value

                current memory: [0]
                input:      0
                expected:   0

                current memory: [1]
                input:      0
                expected:   1
                                            pass

                current memory: [-1]
                input:       2
                expected:    -1
